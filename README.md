Asterisk Configuration
======================

Sort of "Spotify" over VoIP written in the Asterisk own scripting language.

On an income call a voice asks for a number to be dialed after telling us what will be played on each one.

Using sort of an interface through the standar System IO, Asterisk crappy scripting language can be avoided so that you only have to write some modules, leaving the hard work for a real language.
